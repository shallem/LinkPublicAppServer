/**
 * Abstract interface for a client object that can handle push notification events.
 * In general, push notifications can be originated by the push server, which
 * accepts incoming notification requests to stylized URLs, or by any other piece
 * of the code. Each push receiver is intended to be a persistent, single user, single app
 * encapsulation of the current push state. When a push event is received, it should
 * be routed to the right receiver based on unique details of the push event that
 * reveal the client and user. The push receiver is then responsible for acting
 * on the push event, including sending the push notification via the Controller, which
 * provides a web service for sending out push events.
