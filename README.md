This repository will soon contain a standalone server that can be used
to host and test applications built using the Link SDK. For this
sample server we use glassfish v3.1.2.2 and JavaEE 6.

The Link SDK DOES NOT have any particular dependencies on the server
environment - anything from plain old apache to .NET to PHP, etc. will
work - so view this repository as an illustrative example of how to
build a complete application using the Link SDK, including both the
front end (built in Javascript/CSS3/HTML5) and a server back end.

This repository is also useful for Mobile Helix customers who are
interested in integrating a custom server of their own with the Mobile
Helix authentication infrastructure. There are several parts to this
puzzle, with more documentation to follow:

1) A web service must be created on your custom server. That web
service should receive binary data in the BSON format
(http://bsonspec.org/) that deserializes into an object of type
ApplicationServerCreateSessionRequest. See
ApplicationServerWebServices/src/java/com/mobilehelix/services/objects. For
example web services see the project ApplicationServer-adminws.

2) You must implement custom session management to secure access to
your custom applications. See the SessionManager, Session
(ApplicationServer-ejbPublic/src/java/com/mobilehelix/appserver/session),
and InitFilter
(ApplicationServer-ejbPublic/src/java/com/mobilehelix/appserver/jsf)
objects for an example.

We are happy to answer any questions while our documentation remains a
work in progress.

Our master plan is to release (in the near future) a fully open
source, and standalone application that shows how the Link SDK may be
used to provide a simple file browser for CIFS file shares. Stay tuned
if that sounds interesting. We are working hard on preparing our code
for release.

Each project in this repository is a NetBeans 7.2 project. At the
moment we are not distributing the required open source dependencies,
although we plan to do so soon. The following libraries are required:

jcifs (tested with 1.3.17)
Apache HTTP client (tested with v4.2.3)
Apache HTTP core (tested with v4.2.3)
Jersey Bundle (tested with v1.14)
Apache Commons HTTP client (tested with v3.1)
Apache Commons Codec (tested with v1.7)

Also, this project requires JDK 1.7.
